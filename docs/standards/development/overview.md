# Development Standards Overview

Start here: `docs/standards/standards.md` → `development/development.md` (dispatcher) → common standards.

Tool configuration guidance covering setup, local development environment, testing configuration, and workflow tools.

Use the category dispatcher at `docs/standards/development/development.md` to route to specific standards. Dispatchers are routing-only.
