# Architecture Standards Overview

Start here: `docs/standards/standards.md` → `architecture/architecture.md` (dispatcher) → common standards.

Architectural guidance aligned with Clean Architecture and modern patterns.

Use the category dispatcher at `docs/standards/architecture/architecture.md` to route to specific standards. Dispatchers are routing-only.
