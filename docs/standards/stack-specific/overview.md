Start here: `docs/standards/standards.md` → `stack-specific/stack-specific.md` (dispatcher) → common standards.

Technology stack specific patterns and best practices for the current stack (e.g., Drizzle, Hono, Next Safe Action, TanStack Query, Vercel AI, Vercel deployment, Zustand).

Use the category dispatcher at `docs/standards/stack-specific/stack-specific.md` to route to specific standards. Dispatchers are routing-only.
