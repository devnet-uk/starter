# Code Style Standards Overview

Start here: `docs/standards/standards.md` → `code-style.md` (dispatcher) → common standards.

Code style standards for consistent formatting, naming, and organization across languages and frameworks.

Use the category dispatcher at `docs/standards/code-style.md` to route to specific standards. Dispatchers are routing-only.
