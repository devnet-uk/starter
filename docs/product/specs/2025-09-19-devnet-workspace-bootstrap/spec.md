# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: DevNet Workspace Bootstrap + Preflight
> Created: 2025-09-19

## Overview

Establish a clean DevNet workspace with initialized git repository, configured remote origin, verified pnpm/Turbo toolchain alignment, and scaffolded environment files. This foundation enables Phase A Engineering OS integration and ensures consistent development environment setup across the DevNet migration process.

## User Stories

### DevNet Developer Workspace Setup

As a DevNet developer, I want to bootstrap a clean workspace from an empty directory, so that I can start with a properly configured repository and development environment.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer navigates to empty `~/Projects/devnet/` directory
2. Runs workspace bootstrap command to initialize git repository
3. Sets up remote origin pointing to DevNet repository
4. Verifies pnpm and Turbo are properly aligned with project requirements
5. Scaffolds essential environment configuration files
6. Validates that workspace is ready for Engineering OS integration

### Environment Validation and Alignment

As a DevNet developer, I want automated verification of my development toolchain, so that I can ensure compatibility before beginning implementation work.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. System checks Node.js version compatibility (20+)
2. Validates pnpm installation and version alignment (10.16.0+)
3. Verifies Turbo installation and compatibility (2.5.6+)
4. Confirms Docker availability for database services
5. Reports any misalignment issues with remediation guidance

## Spec Scope

1. **Git Repository Initialization** - Initialize empty git repository with main branch and initial commit
2. **Remote Origin Configuration** - Set up git remote origin with DevNet repository URL
3. **Toolchain Verification** - Validate pnpm, Turbo, Node.js, and Docker installations against project requirements
4. **Environment Scaffolding** - Create essential environment files (.env.local, docker-compose.yml) with DevNet configurations
5. **Workspace Validation** - Confirm workspace readiness for Engineering OS foundation setup

## Out of Scope

- Engineering OS standards installation (handled in subsequent Phase A steps)
- Package dependencies installation (deferred until project structure is copied)
- Database schema setup (handled in later phases)
- Application configuration beyond environment scaffolding

## Expected Deliverable

1. Clean git repository in `~/Projects/devnet/` with configured remote origin and initial commit
2. Validated development toolchain (pnpm 10.16.0+, Turbo 2.5.6+, Node 20+, Docker available)
3. Scaffolded environment files (.env.local with DevNet database configuration, docker-compose.yml for PostgreSQL)
