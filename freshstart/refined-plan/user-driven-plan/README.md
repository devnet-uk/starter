# DevNet User-Driven Implementation Plan

> **Complete manual execution guide for implementing the DevNet SaaS application**

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive, user-driven implementation plan that transforms the AI-agent dispatcher system into clear, step-by-step instructions for manual execution. Each phase includes smart prompts designed to leverage Claude Code's capabilities while maintaining full user control.

## What's Inside

### 📚 Main Guides

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **[EXECUTION-GUIDE.md](EXECUTION-GUIDE.md)** | Master implementation guide | Start here - overview and navigation |
| **[environment-setup.md](environment-setup.md)** | Complete environment configuration | Before starting any phases |
| **[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)** | Common issues and solutions | When things go wrong |
| **[recovery-procedures.md](recovery-procedures.md)** | Step-by-step recovery procedures | When you need to reset or rollback |

### 🏗️ Phase Implementation Guides

| Phase | File | Duration | Goal |
|-------|------|----------|------|
| **A** | [phase-a-instructions.md](phase-a-instructions.md) | 2-3 hours | Foundation & tooling setup |
| **B** | [phase-b-instructions.md](phase-b-instructions.md) | 4-6 hours | Architecture spine (contracts, core, infrastructure) |
| **C** | [phase-c-instructions.md](phase-c-instructions.md) | 8-12 hours | Domain capabilities (Auth, Orgs, Billing, Platform) |
| **D** | [phase-d-instructions.md](phase-d-instructions.md) | 6-8 hours | Delivery layers (API + Frontend + E2E) |
| **E** | [phase-e-instructions.md](phase-e-instructions.md) | 4-6 hours | Production hardening & enablement |

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup (15 minutes)
```bash
# Follow the environment setup guide
open environment-setup.md
```

### 2. Begin Implementation
```bash
# Start with the main execution guide
open EXECUTION-GUIDE.md
```

### 3. Execute Phase by Phase
```bash
# Execute phases sequentially: A → B → C → D → E
# Each phase has copy-ready prompts for Claude Code
```

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Smart Prompts**
Each step includes carefully crafted prompts that:
- Trigger automatic context loading via the dispatcher system
- Provide complete project context
- Include specific step references
- Give Claude Code everything needed for execution

### 📋 **Copy-Paste Ready**
Every prompt is designed for immediate use:
```
🔗 COPY THIS TO CLAUDE CODE:

I'm implementing DevNet phase-a foundation workspace setup (Step A1.1).

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Repository: ${DEVNET_GIT_REMOTE}
- Target: ~/Projects/devnet/
- Environment: Development setup for SaaS application

TASK: Execute workspace bootstrap following phase-a-foundation.md Step A1.1.
...
```

### ✅ **Built-in Verification**
Each step includes verification commands:
```bash
echo "🔍 Step A1.1 Verification:"
echo "- Git repository: $([ -d .git ] && echo '✅' || echo '❌')"
echo "- pnpm workspace: $([ -f pnpm-workspace.yaml ] && echo '✅' || echo '❌')"
# ... more checks
```

### 🔄 **Recovery Procedures**
Comprehensive recovery options for when things go wrong:
- Soft recovery (fix issues without losing work)
- Phase reset (restart current phase)
- Checkpoint reset (go back to last completed phase)
- Hard reset (complete restart)

## Implementation Flow

### Phase Dependencies
```
Phase A (Foundation)
    ↓
Phase B (Architecture Spine)
    ↓
Phase C (Domain Waves)
    ├── Wave C1: Auth & Identity
    ├── Wave C2: Organizations
    ├── Wave C3: Billing & Payments
    └── Wave C4: Platform Services
    ↓
Phase D (Delivery Layers)
    ├── API Delivery
    ├── Frontend Migration
    └── E2E Testing
    ↓
Phase E (Production Hardening)
```

### Execution Strategy
1. **Sequential** (recommended): Complete phases in order A→B→C→D→E
2. **Parallel** (advanced): After Wave C1, run C2-C4 simultaneously

### Progress Tracking
- **DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt**: Updated after each major step
- **Git commits**: Created at specified commit points
- **Verification commands**: Run after each step
- **Git tags**: Created after each phase completion

## What You'll Build

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain-driven design with proper layer separation
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E testing
- **Quality**: Strict linting, formatting, and architectural boundaries

### 💼 Business Capabilities
- **Authentication**: User registration, MFA, session management
- **Organizations**: Multi-tenant collaboration with RBAC
- **Billing**: Subscription management with multiple payment providers
- **Platform Services**: AI chat, file storage, email, audit logging

### 🚀 Production Readiness
- **Observability**: Monitoring, logging, metrics, health checks
- **Security**: Threat modeling, security hardening, compliance
- **Deployment**: Automated CI/CD with rollback capabilities
- **Documentation**: Complete runbooks and operational guides

## Key Design Principles

### 🧠 **Leverages Dispatcher Intelligence**
The original plan includes a sophisticated dispatcher system that automatically loads relevant context based on keywords. The smart prompts are designed to trigger this system:

- Keywords like "phase-a foundation" automatically load `phase-a-foundation.md`
- Context is loaded within the ≤3 hops budget
- Users get the benefits of automatic context without complex setup

### 📝 **User Control Maintained**
While leveraging AI assistance:
- All prompts are explicit and transparent
- Users copy exactly what they want to execute
- No hidden automation or black box behavior
- Complete audit trail through git commits

### 🔧 **Practical Implementation Focus**
- Real-world time estimates based on complexity
- Troubleshooting for common issues
- Recovery procedures for failed steps
- Verification at every checkpoint
