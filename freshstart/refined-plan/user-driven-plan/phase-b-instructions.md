# Phase B: Architecture Spine ‚Äî User Instructions

> **Duration**: 4-6 hours | **Goal**: Create contracts, core abstractions, and infrastructure interfaces

## Overview

Phase B builds the architectural foundation that all domain logic will depend on. You'll create API contracts (Zod schemas), clean architecture primitives (entities, value objects), and infrastructure interfaces - but no concrete implementations yet.

**What you'll build:**
- `packages/contracts` - API schemas and OpenAPI generation
- `packages/core` - Domain primitives and shared kernel
- `packages/infrastructure` - Repository and service interfaces
- Architecture quality gates and dependency enforcement

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, verify Phase A is complete:

```bash
cd "${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"

echo "üîç Phase A Prerequisites:"
echo "- Git repository: $([ -d .git ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Workspace config: $([ -f pnpm-workspace.yaml ] && [ -f turbo.json ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Tooling setup: $([ -f tsconfig.base.json ] && [ -f biome.json ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- EOS integration: $([ -d scripts ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Verification: $(pnpm verify:local >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Git clean: $([ $(git status --porcelain | wc -l) -eq 0 ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"

# Check checkpoint
grep -q 'Phase A' DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt && echo "- Checkpoint: ‚úÖ" || echo "- Checkpoint: ‚ùå"
```

**Expected**: All items should show ‚úÖ

## Step B1: Contracts Package Creation

### Step B1.1: Create API Contracts Foundation

**üîó COPY THIS TO CLAUDE CODE:**

```
I'm implementing DevNet phase-b architecture contracts package (Step B1).

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Working directory: ${DEVNET_HOME:-~/Projects/devnet/}
- Goal: Create contracts package as single source of truth for API contracts
- Dependencies: Zero downstream dependencies, consumed by API and frontend
- Tech stack: Zod schemas, OpenAPI generation, TypeScript

CURRENT STATUS: Phase A foundation complete, starting Phase B architecture spine
SPECIFIC TASK: Execute Step B1 from phase-b-architecture.md

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENT:
This contracts package will be the foundational layer that defines all API interfaces across 4 domain areas:
- Authentication (user registration, sessions, MFA)
- Organizations (multi-tenant, RBAC, memberships)
- Billing (subscriptions, payments, usage tracking)
- Platform services (AI chat, storage, email, audit)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Please execute the contracts package creation following the DevNet phase-b architecture plan.

Run these commands in sequence:
1. /create-spec "Contracts package bootstrap ‚Äî zod schemas, HTTP contracts, OpenAPI automation. Pull requirements from features/auth/specification.md, features/organizations/specification.md, features/payments/specification.md, and features/api/specification.md."
2. /create-tasks
3. /execute-tasks

Ensure all deliverables from Step B1 are completed:
- packages/contracts as new workspace package with proper exports
- Zod schemas organized by domain (auth, organizations, billing, platform)
- OpenAPI generation script (pnpm --filter @repo/contracts build:openapi)
- Contract validation tests with ‚â•95% coverage
- Clean integration with workspace configuration
```

### Verification After B1

Run this to verify Step B1 completed successfully:

```bash
cd "${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"

- Purpose: Base classes that all domain entities and value objects will extend
- Quality: 100% test coverage, zero framework dependencies

CURRENT STATUS: Contracts package complete, now building core domain abstractions
SPECIFIC TASK: Execute Step B2 from phase-b-architecture.md

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENT:
Create the foundational domain abstractions that enforce clean architecture principles:
- Entity<T> - Base entity with identity and equality
- ValueObject<T> - Immutable value objects with structural equality
- DomainEvent - Base class for domain events with metadata
- Result<T, E> - Railway-oriented programming for error handling
- Guard - Argument validation utilities

These will be used across all 4 domain areas (Auth, Organizations, Billing, Platform).

INSTRUCTIONS:
Please execute the core shared kernel creation following the DevNet phase-b architecture plan.

Run these commands in sequence:
1. /create-spec "Core shared kernel ‚Äî entities, value objects, domain events, result/guard utilities. Reference terminology across features/auth/specification.md, features/organizations/specification.md, features/payments/specification.md, and features/ui-components/specification.md."
2. /create-tasks
3. /execute-tasks

- Architecture: Dependency inversion - interfaces in infrastructure, implementations later

CURRENT STATUS: Contracts and core complete, now defining infrastructure boundaries
SPECIFIC TASK: Execute Step B3 from phase-b-architecture.md

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENT:
Create interface definitions only - no concrete implementations yet:
- Repository interfaces for all major aggregates (User, Organization, Subscription, etc.)
- Service interfaces for external integrations (Storage, Email, Payments, AI)
- Anti-corruption layers for external service integration
- Shared mapper abstractions between domain and integration contracts
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging context, error translation)

Integration needs from feature specifications:
- Storage services (file upload, media management)
- Email services (transactional, notifications)
- Payment services (Stripe, LemonSqueezy, etc.)
- AI services (chat, embeddings)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Please execute the infrastructure scaffolding following the DevNet phase-b architecture plan.

Run these commands in sequence:

- Service abstractions for external integrations
- Anti-corruption layer base classes
- Shared infrastructure utilities and mappers
- No concrete implementations (use in-memory fakes for testing)
```

### Phase B Acceptance Criteria

‚úÖ **Contracts Package**: Zod schemas with OpenAPI generation
‚úÖ **Core Shared Kernel**: Domain primitives with 100% coverage
‚úÖ **Infrastructure Interfaces**: Repository and service contracts
‚úÖ **Quality Gates**: Architecture tests and CI integration
‚úÖ **Verification**: `pnpm verify:local` passes consistently

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Circular dependency errors
**Solution**: Check package import directions. Contracts ‚Üí dependency-free, Core ‚Üí uses Contracts, Infrastructure ‚Üí uses both.

**Issue**: OpenAPI generation fails
**Solution**: Ensure zod-to-openapi tooling is configured in contracts package.

**Issue**: Architecture tests failing
**Solution**: Review dependency-cruiser config. Ensure clean layer separation.

**Issue**: Coverage below 100% for core
**Solution**: Add missing tests for shared kernel utilities.

## Next Phase

**üéâ Phase B Complete!**

- ‚úÖ Contract schemas defining all API interfaces
- ‚úÖ Clean architecture primitives (Entity, ValueObject, DomainEvent, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure interfaces for external integrations
- ‚úÖ Architecture quality gates preventing violations
- ‚úÖ CI integration and automated testing

**üëâ Next**: Proceed to **[Phase C: Domain Capability Waves](phase-c-instructions.md)** to implement the actual business logic across 4 domain areas: Authentication, Organizations, Billing, and Platform Services.
