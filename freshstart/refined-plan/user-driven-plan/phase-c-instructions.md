# Phase C: Domain Capability Waves ‚Äî User Instructions

> **Duration**: 8-12 hours (2-3 hours per wave) | **Goal**: Implement business logic across 4 domain areas

## Overview

Phase C implements the actual business logic of your application across four domain capability waves. Each wave builds specific domain capabilities using the architecture spine from Phase B. All waves must achieve 100% coverage on domain/use-case modules.

**What you'll build:**
- **Wave C1**: Authentication & Identity (2-3 hours)
- **Wave C2**: Organizations & RBAC (2-3 hours)
- **Wave C3**: Billing & Payments (3-4 hours)
- **Wave C4**: Platform Services (2-3 hours)

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, verify Phase B is complete:

```bash
cd "${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"

echo "üîç Phase B Prerequisites:"
echo "- Contracts package: $([ -f packages/contracts/package.json ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Core package: $([ -f packages/core/package.json ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Infrastructure package: $([ -f packages/infrastructure/package.json ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Full build: $(pnpm build >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Verification: $(pnpm verify:local >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"

# Check checkpoint
grep -A2 -B2 "Phase B" DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "‚ùå Missing Phase B checkpoint"
```

**Expected**: All items should show ‚úÖ

## Wave Execution Strategy

### Sequential Approach (Recommended)
Execute waves in order: **C1 ‚Üí C2 ‚Üí C3 ‚Üí C4**
- Authentication (C1) is foundational for all others
- Easier debugging and verification
- Clear dependency progression

### Parallel Approach (Advanced)
After completing C1, run C2, C3, C4 simultaneously:
- Complete Wave C1 first (required dependency)
- Use separate Claude Code sessions for C2, C3, C4
- Merge and integrate after all waves complete

### Phase C Acceptance Criteria

‚úÖ **Wave C1**: Authentication & identity management complete
‚úÖ **Wave C2**: Organization management with RBAC implemented
‚úÖ **Wave C3**: Multi-provider billing and subscription logic
‚úÖ **Wave C4**: Platform services (AI, storage, email, audit)
‚úÖ **Coverage**: 100% on all domain business logic modules
‚úÖ **Integration**: In-memory adapters ready for API layer
‚úÖ **Contracts**: Domain events and contracts synchronized

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Test coverage below 100% on domain logic
**Solution**: Review coverage reports, add missing test cases for business rules.

**Issue**: Circular dependencies between waves
**Solution**: Check that waves depend only on shared kernel and prior wave entities.

**Issue**: Contract/domain synchronization failures
**Solution**: Ensure all domain entities have corresponding contract DTOs and mappers.

**Issue**: Memory issues with large test suites
**Solution**: Split large test files or use test suite parallelization.
