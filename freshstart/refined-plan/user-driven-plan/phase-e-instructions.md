- **Step E2**: Security Hardening (1-2 hours)
- **Step E3**: Deployment & Release Operations (1-2 hours)
- **Step E4**: Documentation & Transition (1-2 hours)

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, verify Phase D is complete:

```bash
cd "${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"

echo "üîç Phase D Prerequisites:"
echo "- API package: $([ -d packages/api ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Web app: $([ -d apps/web ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- E2E tests: $([ -d apps/web/tests ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
