# Phase D: Delivery Layers ‚Äî User Instructions

> **Duration**: 6-8 hours | **Goal**: Build API delivery and migrate frontend to Feature-Sliced Design

## Overview

Phase D connects your domain capabilities from Phase C to the user-facing layer. You'll build contract-validated API routes, reorganize the frontend for maintainability, and ensure the end-to-end user experience works perfectly across all domains.

**What you'll build:**
- **Step D1**: API Delivery with Hono routes (2-3 hours)
- **Step D2**: Frontend Feature-Sliced migration (3-4 hours)
- **Step D3**: End-to-end testing with Playwright (2-3 hours)

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, verify Phase C is complete:

```bash
cd "${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"

echo "üîç Phase C Prerequisites:"
echo "- Domain waves: $(find packages/core -name '*User*.ts' -o -name '*Org*.ts' -o -name '*Subscription*.ts' -o -name '*Chat*.ts' | wc -l | tr -d ' ') major entities"
echo "- Use case services: $(find packages/core -name '*UseCase*.ts' -o -name '*Service*.ts' | wc -l | tr -d ' ') services"
echo "- Repository interfaces: $(find packages/infrastructure -name '*Repository*.ts' | wc -l | tr -d ' ') interfaces"
echo "- Full build: $(pnpm build >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Domain tests: $(pnpm --filter @repo/core test >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Overall verification: $(pnpm verify:local >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"

# Check Phase C checkpoint
grep -A3 "Phase C" DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "‚ùå Missing Phase C checkpoint"
```

**Expected**: Multiple entities from all 4 waves, tests pass, verification succeeds

## Step D1: API Delivery Alignment

### Step D1.1: Create API Package with Hono Routes

**üîó COPY THIS TO CLAUDE CODE:**

```
I'm implementing DevNet phase-d delivery API layer (Step D1).

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Working directory: ${DEVNET_HOME:-~/Projects/devnet/}
- Goal: Expose domain capabilities through clean HTTP APIs using Hono framework
- Architecture: Contract-validated routes with comprehensive middleware stack
- Integration: Connect to domain use cases from Phase C

CURRENT STATUS: Phase C domain capabilities complete, starting Phase D delivery layers
SPECIFIC TASK: Execute Step D1 from phase-d-delivery.md

API ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
**Primary Goal**: Create packages/api with Hono framework exposing domain capabilities

**Route Organization by Domain** (matching Phase C waves):
- routes/auth/ - Authentication and session management
- routes/organizations/ - Organization and membership management
- routes/billing/ - Subscription and payment management
- routes/platform/ - AI, storage, email, and audit services

**Middleware Stack Requirements**:
- Authentication middleware (session/JWT validation)
- Authorization middleware (RBAC integration from Wave C2)
- Rate limiting per tenant and endpoint
- Multi-tenant context extraction and validation
- Request/response validation using contracts schemas from Phase B
- Error handling with consistent HTTP status codes
- Logging with correlation IDs

**Integration Requirements**:
- Connect API routes to domain use cases from packages/core
- Use repository interfaces with in-memory implementations from Phase C
- Implement middleware enforcing business policies and security
- Contract synchronization job preventing schema drift (CI integration)

**Feature Specifications for Coverage**:
- features/auth/specification.md - Authentication endpoints
- features/organizations/specification.md - Organization management APIs
- features/payments/specification.md - Billing and subscription endpoints
- features/api/specification.md - General API patterns and error handling

**Quality Standards**:
- All routes must be contract-validated (Zod schemas from Phase B)
- 95%+ integration test coverage on API endpoints
- Security testing for authentication bypass prevention
- Contract drift detection in CI pipeline

INSTRUCTIONS:
Please execute the API delivery alignment following the DevNet phase-d delivery plan.

Run these commands in sequence:
1. /create-spec "API delivery ‚Äî hono routes generated from contracts, validation middleware, integration tests. Reference features/auth/specification.md, features/organizations/specification.md, features/payments/specification.md, and features/api/specification.md for endpoint coverage."
2. /create-tasks
3. /execute-tasks

Create a production-ready API layer that safely exposes your domain capabilities with enterprise security patterns.
```

‚úÖ **E2E Testing**: Playwright test suites covering all critical user journeys
‚úÖ **Integration**: API ‚Üî Frontend working seamlessly with proper error handling
‚úÖ **CI Pipeline**: Automated testing integrated into development workflow

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: API routes not connecting to domain use cases
**Solution**: Verify dependency injection and repository interfaces are properly connected.

**Issue**: Frontend build failures after FSD migration
**Solution**: Check TypeScript path mapping in tsconfig.json and update import statements.

**Issue**: E2E tests failing or flaky
**Solution**: Review test data seeding, add proper wait conditions, check for race conditions.

**Issue**: Contract validation errors
**Solution**: Ensure API request/response schemas match contracts exactly.
