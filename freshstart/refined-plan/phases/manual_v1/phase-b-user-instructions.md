# Phase B: Architecture Spine ‚Äî User Instructions

> **Goal**: Create the foundational architecture with contracts, core abstractions, and infrastructure interfaces.

## Quick Context

You're building the architectural foundation that all domain logic will depend on. This includes API contracts (Zod schemas), clean architecture primitives (entities, value objects), and infrastructure interfaces (repositories, services) - but no concrete implementations yet.

**Duration**: 4-6 hours
**Prerequisites**: Phase A complete with workspace validation passing
**Next Phase**: Phase C (Domain Capability Waves)

## Before You Start

### Phase A Completion Check
Copy and run this verification:

```bash
DEVNET_PATH="${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"
cd "$DEVNET_PATH"

echo "üîç Phase A Prerequisites Check:"
echo "- Working directory: $(pwd)"
echo "- Git initialized: $([ -d .git ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- pnpm workspace: $([ -f pnpm-workspace.yaml ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Verify command: $(pnpm verify:local >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ passes' || echo '‚ùå fails')"
echo "- Clean git state: $([ $(git status --porcelain | wc -l) -eq 0 ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå uncommitted changes')"
echo ""

if [ -f DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt ]; then
  echo "üìã Last Checkpoint:"
  tail -3 DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt
else
  echo "‚ùå Missing DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt - ensure Phase A is complete"
fi
```

### Expected Output
All items should show ‚úÖ. If not, complete Phase A first.

## Step B1: Contracts Package Creation

### What You're Doing
Creating a contracts package with Zod schemas, HTTP request/response types, and OpenAPI generation - serving as the single source of truth for API contracts.

### Copy This Into Claude Code:

```
I need to implement Phase B, Step B1: Contracts Package Creation for the DevNet architecture spine.

**Context**:
- This is Phase B of the DevNet clean architecture implementation
- I'm building the foundational contracts package that will be the single source of truth for all API contracts
- This package must have zero downstream dependencies and will be consumed by both API and frontend

**Requirements**:
1. Create `packages/contracts` as a new workspace package
2. Implement Zod schemas for all major domain contracts
3. Set up OpenAPI generation workflow from the schemas
4. Create contract tests ensuring schema integrity
5. Set up proper package exports with barrel files (api, domain, schemas modules)

**Feature Specifications to Reference**:
- `features/auth/specification.md` - Authentication contracts
- `features/organizations/specification.md` - Organization and membership contracts
- `features/payments/specification.md` - Billing and subscription contracts
- `features/api/specification.md` - General API patterns and conventions

**Architecture Standards**:
- Follow `docs/standards/development/api-contracts.md`
- Ensure zero circular dependencies
- ‚â•95% test coverage for all contract schemas
- OpenAPI generation must be automated via npm script

**Deliverables**:
- `packages/contracts/` package with proper package.json
- Zod schemas organized by domain (auth, organizations, billing, etc.)
- Barrel exports for clean imports
- OpenAPI generation script (e.g., `pnpm --filter @repo/contracts build:openapi`)
- Contract validation tests
- Updated workspace configuration to include new package

Please create this contracts package step-by-step, ensuring all schemas are properly typed and tested.
```

### Verify Success:
```bash
cd "${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"

echo "- Workspace config: $(grep -q contracts pnpm-workspace.yaml && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"

if [ -d packages/contracts ]; then
  cd packages/contracts
  echo "- Source directory: $([ -d src ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
  echo "- Schema files: $(find src -name '*.ts' | wc -l | tr -d ' ') files found"
  echo "- Test files: $(find . -name '*.test.ts' -o -name '*.spec.ts' | wc -l | tr -d ' ') test files found"

  # Check if OpenAPI script exists
  if [ -f package.json ]; then
    if grep -q "build:openapi" package.json; then
      echo "- OpenAPI script: ‚úÖ"
    else
      echo "- OpenAPI script: ‚ùå missing"
    fi
  fi

  cd ../..
fi

# Test build
echo ""
echo "üß™ Build Test:"
if pnpm --filter @repo/contracts build >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "- Package builds: ‚úÖ"
else
  echo "- Package builds: ‚ùå build failed"
fi
```

### Expected Output
- All package structure items should show ‚úÖ
- Build test should pass
- Should find multiple schema and test files

### Commit Checkpoint
```bash
cd "${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"
git add packages/contracts pnpm-workspace.yaml turbo.json
git commit -m "feat(phase-b): contracts package established"

## Step B2: Core Shared Kernel

### What You're Doing
Creating the shared domain primitives (Entity, ValueObject, DomainEvent, Result types) that all domain logic will inherit from, following clean architecture principles.

### Copy This Into Claude Code:

```
Phase B, Step B2: Core Shared Kernel implementation - the foundational domain abstractions.

## Step B3: Infrastructure Surface Definition

### What You're Doing
Creating infrastructure interfaces and anti-corruption layers without concrete implementations - establishing the contracts that adapters will implement later.

### Copy This Into Claude Code:

```
Phase B, Step B3: Infrastructure Surface Definition - establishing adapter interfaces and boundaries.

**Context**:
- Creating `packages/infrastructure` with interface definitions only
- No concrete implementations yet - just the contracts that adapters will fulfill

**Requirements**:
1. Create `packages/infrastructure` workspace package
2. Define repository interfaces for all major aggregates
3. Create service interfaces for external integrations
4. Implement anti-corruption layer patterns
5. Set up shared mapper abstractions
6. Define cross-cutting concerns (logging, error handling)

**Integration Requirements from Features**:
- `features/storage/specification.md` - File and media storage interfaces
- `features/email/specification.md` - Email service abstractions
- `features/payments/specification.md` - Payment provider interfaces

**Architecture Standards**:
- Follow `docs/standards/architecture/integration-strategy.md`
- Dependency inversion principle - interfaces in core, implementations in infrastructure
- Anti-corruption layers for all external services
- Shared mapping strategies between domain and integration contracts

**Structure**:
- `src/interfaces/` - Repository and service interfaces
- `src/shared/` - Base mapper abstractions and utilities
- `src/types/` - Infrastructure-specific type definitions
- Cross-cutting concerns: logging context, error translation, etc.

**Quality Requirements**:
- All interfaces must be generic and testable
- No concrete implementations (use in-memory fakes for testing)
- Clear separation between domain contracts and external contracts
- Comprehensive interface documentation

**Deliverables**:
- Infrastructure interfaces package
- Repository interfaces aligned with domain aggregates
- Service abstractions for external integrations

### Phase B Acceptance Criteria
‚úÖ **Contracts Package**: Zod schemas with OpenAPI generation
‚úÖ **Core Shared Kernel**: Domain primitives with 100% coverage
‚úÖ **Infrastructure Interfaces**: Repository and service contracts
‚úÖ **Quality Gates**: Architecture tests and CI integration
‚úÖ **Verification**: `pnpm verify:local` passes consistently

### Rollback Procedure (If Needed)
If Phase B needs to be restarted:

```bash
cd "${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"

# Reset to Phase A completion
git reset --hard HEAD~4  # Adjust based on number of Phase B commits
rm -rf packages/contracts packages/core packages/infrastructure
git clean -fd
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue**: Circular dependency errors
**Solution**: Check that packages don't import from each other in wrong directions. Contracts should be dependency-free, Core can use Contracts, Infrastructure can use both.

**Issue**: OpenAPI generation fails
**Solution**: Ensure zod-to-openapi or similar tooling is properly configured in contracts package.

**Issue**: Architecture tests failing
**Solution**: Review dependency-cruiser config or custom architecture test rules. Ensure clean separation between layers.

**Issue**: Coverage below 100% for core
**Solution**: Add missing test cases for all shared kernel utilities. Core domain logic must have complete test coverage.
