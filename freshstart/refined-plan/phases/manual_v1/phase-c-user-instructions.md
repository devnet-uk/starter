# Phase C: Domain Capability Waves ‚Äî User Instructions

> **Goal**: Implement the four core domain capability waves with complete business logic, use cases, and domain services.

## Quick Context

You're now implementing the actual business logic of the application across four domain areas. Each wave builds specific domain capabilities using the architecture spine from Phase B. All waves must achieve 100% coverage on domain/use-case modules.

**Duration**: 8-12 hours (2-3 hours per wave)
**Prerequisites**: Phase B architecture spine complete with all packages building
**Next Phase**: Phase D (Delivery Layers)

## Before You Start

### Phase B Completion Check
Copy and run this verification:

```bash
DEVNET_PATH="${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"
cd "$DEVNET_PATH"

echo "üîç Phase B Prerequisites Check:"
echo "- Working directory: $(pwd)"
echo "- Contracts package: $([ -f packages/contracts/package.json ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Core package: $([ -f packages/core/package.json ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Infrastructure package: $([ -f packages/infrastructure/package.json ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Full build: $(pnpm build >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Verification: $(pnpm verify:local >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo ""

if [ -f DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt ]; then
  echo "üìã Last Checkpoint:"
  grep -A2 -B2 "Phase B" DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt || tail -3 DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt
else
  echo "‚ùå Missing DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt - ensure Phase B is complete"
fi
```

### Expected Output
All items should show ‚úÖ. If not, complete Phase B first.

## Wave Execution Strategy

### Sequential Approach (Recommended)
Execute waves in order: **C1 ‚Üí C2 ‚Üí C3 ‚Üí C4**
- Each wave builds on concepts from previous waves
- Easier to debug and verify incrementally
- Authentication (C1) is foundational for all others

### Parallel Approach (Advanced)
After completing C1, you can run C2, C3, C4 simultaneously if you have multiple Claude sessions:
- Complete Wave C1 first (authentication is required by other domains)
- Run C2, C3, C4 in parallel using separate Claude Code instances
- Merge and test integration after all waves complete

---

## Wave C1: Authentication & Identity

### What You're Doing
Implementing user authentication, session management, MFA policies, and identity-related use cases as the foundation for all other domains.

### Copy This Into Claude Code:

```
Phase C, Wave C1: Authentication & Identity domain implementation.

**Context**:
- This is the foundational domain wave - all other domains depend on authentication
- Building comprehensive user identity management with modern security patterns
- Must integrate with the contracts and core architecture from Phase B

**Domain Scope**:
**Entities to Implement**:
- `User` - Core user entity with identity, profile, and security attributes
- `Session` - User session management with expiration and security tracking
- `Credential` - User authentication credentials (password, passkeys, OAuth tokens)
- `MfaDevice` - Multi-factor authentication device management

**Use Cases to Implement**:
- User registration and email verification
- Sign-in with password and passkey support
- Multi-factor authentication enrollment and challenges
- Password reset and recovery flows
- Session rotation and security management

**Domain Events**:
- `UserRegistered` - New user account created
- `UserAuthenticated` - Successful authentication event
- `MfaChallengeRequested` - MFA challenge initiated
- `SessionCreated`, `SessionExpired` - Session lifecycle events

**Feature Specifications**:
- Primary: `features/auth/specification.md` - Authentication requirements and flows
- Secondary: `features/users/specification.md` - User management and profile data

**Architecture Requirements**:
- Use clean architecture patterns from `packages/core`
- Implement domain services for password hashing, MFA policies (interface-based)
- Create contract-aligned DTO mappers between core and contracts packages
- Achieve 100% test coverage on all business logic
- Use repository interfaces from infrastructure (implement with in-memory fakes)

**Quality Standards**:
- Follow `docs/standards/architecture/clean-architecture.md` verification blocks
- All authentication business rules must be tested
- Security-sensitive code requires extra test coverage for edge cases
- Domain purity - no framework dependencies in core domain code

**Deliverables**:
- Authentication entities with business invariants
- Use case services with comprehensive error handling
- Domain events for audit logging and integration
- In-memory repository implementations for testing
- Contract mappers for API integration
- 100% test coverage with security focus

Implement the authentication domain wave with enterprise-grade security patterns.

else
  echo "- Contract tests: ‚ùå failing"
fi

# Test coverage check
echo "- Coverage report: run 'pnpm --filter @repo/core test -- --coverage' to verify ‚â•100%"
```

# Create phase tag
git add DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt DEVNET-PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "docs(phase-c): all domain capability waves completed"
git tag v0.3.0-phase-c
```

### Phase C Acceptance Criteria
‚úÖ **Wave C1**: Authentication & identity management complete
‚úÖ **Wave C2**: Organization management with RBAC implemented
‚úÖ **Wave C3**: Multi-provider billing and subscription logic
‚úÖ **Wave C4**: Platform services (AI, storage, email, audit)
‚úÖ **Coverage**: 100% on all domain business logic modules
‚úÖ **Integration**: In-memory adapters ready for API layer
‚úÖ **Contracts**: Domain events and contracts synchronized

### Rollback Procedure (If Needed)
To restart specific waves or the entire phase:

```bash
cd "${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"

# Reset to Phase B completion (restart all waves)
git reset --hard v0.2.0-phase-b  # Or find Phase B completion commit
git clean -fd

# Or reset to specific wave (example: restart from Wave C2)
git reset --hard HEAD~6  # Adjust based on commits since C1
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue**: Test coverage below 100% on domain logic
**Solution**: Review coverage reports and add missing test cases for business rules and edge cases.

**Issue**: Circular dependencies between domain waves
**Solution**: Check that waves depend only on shared kernel and prior wave entities, not circular references.

**Issue**: Contract/domain synchronization failures
**Solution**: Ensure all domain entities have corresponding contract DTOs and mappers.

**Issue**: Memory issues with large test suites
**Solution**: Consider splitting large test files or using test suite parallelization.
