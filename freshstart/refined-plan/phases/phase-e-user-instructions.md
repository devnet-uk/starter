# Phase E: Production Hardening & Enablement ‚Äî User Instructions

> **Goal**: Transform your functional application into a production-ready system with observability, security, deployment automation, and comprehensive documentation.

## Quick Context

You have a fully functional application from Phase D. Now you're adding the operational capabilities needed for production: monitoring, security hardening, automated deployment, and the documentation/runbooks needed for ongoing operations and team handoff.

**Duration**: 4-6 hours
**Prerequisites**: Phase D delivery layers complete with E2E tests passing
**Result**: Production-ready application with operational excellence

## Before You Start

### Phase D Completion Check
Copy and run this verification:

```bash
DEVNET_PATH="${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"
cd "$DEVNET_PATH"

echo "üîç Phase D Prerequisites Check:"
echo "- Working directory: $(pwd)"
echo "- API package: $([ -d packages/api ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Web app: $([ -d apps/web ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- E2E tests: $([ -d apps/web/tests ] && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Full build: $(pnpm build >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- API tests: $(pnpm --filter @repo/api test >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"

echo "- Overall verification: $(pnpm verify:local >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo ""

if [ -f DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt ]; then
  echo "üìã Last Phase D Status:"
  grep -A3 -B3 "Phase D" DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt || tail -5 DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt
else
  echo "‚ùå Missing DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt - ensure Phase D is complete"
fi
```

### Expected Output
