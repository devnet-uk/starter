# Phase D: Delivery Layers ‚Äî User Instructions

> **Goal**: Build the API delivery layer with Hono routes and migrate frontend to Feature-Sliced Design, then add comprehensive E2E testing.

## Quick Context

You're now connecting your domain capabilities from Phase C to the user-facing layer. This involves building contract-validated API routes, reorganizing the frontend for maintainability, and ensuring the end-to-end user experience works perfectly across all domains.

**Duration**: 6-8 hours
**Prerequisites**: Phase C domain capabilities complete with all waves implemented
**Next Phase**: Phase E (Production Hardening & Enablement)

## Before You Start

### Phase C Completion Check
Copy and run this verification:

```bash
DEVNET_PATH="${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"
cd "$DEVNET_PATH"

echo "üîç Phase C Prerequisites Check:"
echo "- Working directory: $(pwd)"
echo "- Domain waves: $(find packages/core -name '*User*.ts' -o -name '*Org*.ts' -o -name '*Subscription*.ts' -o -name '*Chat*.ts' | wc -l | tr -d ' ') major entities"
echo "- Use case services: $(find packages/core -name '*UseCase*.ts' -o -name '*Service*.ts' | wc -l | tr -d ' ') services"
echo "- Repository interfaces: $(find packages/infrastructure -name '*Repository*.ts' | wc -l | tr -d ' ') interfaces"
echo "- Full build: $(pnpm build >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Domain tests: $(pnpm --filter @repo/core test >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo "- Overall verification: $(pnpm verify:local >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo '‚úÖ' || echo '‚ùå')"
echo ""

if [ -f DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt ]; then
  echo "üìã Last Phase C Status:"
  grep -A3 -B3 "Phase C" DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt || tail -5 DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt
else
  echo "‚ùå Missing DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt - ensure Phase C is complete"
fi
```

### Expected Output
- Should find multiple entities from all 4 domain waves
- All builds and tests should pass
- Domain capabilities should be complete and verified

## Step D1: API Delivery Alignment

### What You're Doing
Creating a `packages/api` package with Hono routes that expose your domain capabilities through contract-validated HTTP endpoints with authentication, authorization, and error handling.

### Copy This Into Claude Code:

```
Phase D, Step D1: API Delivery Alignment - exposing domain capabilities through clean HTTP APIs.

**Context**:
- Building the API delivery layer that exposes domain use cases from Phase C
- Using Hono framework for fast, type-safe API routes
- All routes must be contract-validated using schemas from packages/contracts
- Implementing proper middleware stack for authentication, authorization, rate limiting

**API Architecture Requirements**:
1. Create `packages/api` as new workspace package using Hono framework
2. Organize routes by bounded context (auth, organizations, billing, platform)
3. Implement comprehensive middleware stack:
   - Authentication middleware (session/JWT validation)
   - Authorization middleware (RBAC integration)
   - Rate limiting per tenant and endpoint
   - Multi-tenant context extraction and validation
   - Request/response validation using contracts schemas
4. Connect to domain use cases from packages/core
5. Use in-memory adapters from Phase C for testing
6. Add comprehensive integration tests

**Route Organization**:
Organize routes by domain matching Phase C waves:
- `routes/auth/` - Authentication and session management
- `routes/organizations/` - Organization and membership management
- `routes/billing/` - Subscription and payment management
- `routes/platform/` - AI, storage, email, and audit services

**Middleware Requirements**:
- **Authentication**: Validate user sessions and extract user context
- **Authorization**: Enforce RBAC policies based on organization membership
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user and per-tenant rate limits
- **Validation**: Strict request/response validation using Zod schemas from contracts
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- **Logging**: Request/response logging with correlation IDs

**Feature Specifications for API Coverage**:
- `features/auth/specification.md` - Authentication endpoints and flows
- `features/organizations/specification.md` - Organization management APIs
- `features/payments/specification.md` - Billing and subscription endpoints
- `features/api/specification.md` - General API patterns, rate limiting, error handling

**Quality Standards**:
- All API routes must be contract-validated (request/response schemas)
- 95%+ integration test coverage on API endpoints
- Contract synchronization job to prevent schema drift (CI integration)
- Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Security testing for authentication bypass and authorization violations

**Integration Requirements**:
- Connect API routes to domain use cases from packages/core
- Use repository interfaces with in-memory implementations from Phase C
- Implement middleware that enforces business policies and security
- Set up contract drift detection (CI job that fails if API doesn't match contracts)

**Deliverables**:
- `packages/api` with Hono framework setup
- Route files organized by bounded context with proper middleware
- Authentication and authorization middleware integrated with domain
- Rate limiting and tenant isolation middleware
- Integration tests covering all major endpoints
- Contract synchronization verification
- Error handling and logging middleware

Create a production-ready API layer that safely exposes your domain capabilities with enterprise security patterns.

  echo "- API tests: ‚ùå test failures"
fi

# Contract synchronization check
echo "- Contract sync: $(find packages/api -name '*contract*' -o -name '*schema*' | wc -l | tr -d ' ') integration files"
```

echo "Terminal 1: pnpm dev  # Start all services"
echo "Terminal 2: pnpm --filter @repo/web e2e  # Run E2E tests"
echo ""
echo "Or run headless:"
echo "pnpm --filter @repo/web e2e:ci"
```

### Phase D Acceptance Criteria
‚úÖ **API Delivery**: Contract-backed Hono routes with authentication and validation
‚úÖ **Frontend Migration**: Feature-Sliced Design architecture implemented
‚úÖ **Domain UIs**: Complete user interfaces for auth, organizations, billing, platform
‚úÖ **E2E Testing**: Playwright test suites covering all critical user journeys
‚úÖ **Integration**: API ‚Üî Frontend working seamlessly with proper error handling
‚úÖ **CI Pipeline**: Automated testing integrated into development workflow

### Rollback Procedure (If Needed)
To restart Phase D or specific steps:

```bash
cd "${DEVNET_HOME:-$HOME/Projects/devnet}"

# Reset to Phase C completion
git reset --hard v0.3.0-phase-c
git clean -fd

# Or reset specific step (example: restart from Step D2)
git reset --hard HEAD~4  # Adjust based on commits since D1
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue**: API routes not connecting to domain use cases
**Solution**: Verify dependency injection and repository interfaces are properly connected.

**Issue**: Frontend build failures after FSD migration
**Solution**: Check TypeScript path mapping in tsconfig.json and update import statements.

**Issue**: E2E tests failing or flaky
**Solution**: Review test data seeding, add proper wait conditions, check for race conditions.

**Issue**: Contract validation errors
**Solution**: Ensure API request/response schemas match contracts exactly.
