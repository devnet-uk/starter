# DevNet Clean Architecture Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating DevNet's SaaS Application Template from its current implementation to full compliance with the Engineering OS standards. The project benefits from being **greenfield** (no production constraints), enabling aggressive architectural transformation approaches.

**Key Finding**: The current monorepo has significant architectural gaps compared to the standards, but leveraging the Engineering OS framework can transform this into a systematic, AI-driven migration.

## Target Architecture (Standards Compliance)

### Required Package Structure

According to `/docs/standards/architecture/integration-strategy.md`:

```
packages/
├── contracts/              # ❌ MISSING: Type-safe API bridge
│   ├── api/               # HTTP endpoint contracts
│   ├── domain/            # Shared domain types
│   └── schemas/           # Validation schemas
│
├── core/                  # ❌ MISSING: Business logic layer
│   ├── entities/          # Rich domain models
│   ├── use-cases/         # Application business rules
│   ├── interfaces/        # Repository & service interfaces
│   └── shared/            # Domain services
│
├── infrastructure/        # ❌ NEEDS REFACTOR: Implementation layer
│   ├── repositories/      # Database implementations
│   ├── services/          # External service adapters
│   └── database/          # Database-specific code
│
└── api/                   # ❌ NEEDS REFACTOR: Thin controller layer
    └── controllers/       # HTTP routing only
```

### Frontend Structure (Feature-Sliced Design)

According to standards, should be:

```
apps/web/src/
├── app/                   # Application layer (providers, HOCs)
├── processes/            # Complex multi-page flows
├── pages/                # Page compositions  
├── features/             # User interactions
├── entities/             # Business entities UI
└── shared/               # Reusable utilities
```

**Current Reality**: Uses module-based organization instead of FSD layers.

---

## Critical Gap Analysis

### 🔴 **Critical Misalignment #1: Missing Core Layer**

**Standard Requires:**
- `packages/core` with business entities and use cases
- Framework-independent business logic
- Rich domain models with business rules

**Current Reality:**
- Business logic mixed in API routes
- Anemic domain models
- Direct database access from controllers

**Impact**: Violates Clean Architecture dependency rule

### 🔴 **Critical Misalignment #2: No Contract-Driven Development**

**Standard Requires:**
- `packages/contracts` as type-safe bridge
- Zero dependencies except Zod
- Single source of truth for API types

**Current Reality:**
- No contracts package exists
- Frontend/backend coupling through direct imports
- No automatic API validation

**Impact**: Missing type safety and contract validation

### 🔴 **Critical Misalignment #3: Frontend Not Following FSD**

**Standard Requires:**
- Feature-Sliced Design layers
- `features/`, `entities/`, `processes/` organization

**Current Reality:**
- Module-based organization (`modules/marketing/`, `modules/saas/`)
- Domain-driven structure instead of layer-driven

**Impact**: Frontend doesn't align with architectural principles

### 🔴 **Critical Misalignment #4: Database-First vs Domain-First**

**Standard Requires:**
- Domain entities first
- Repository pattern with interfaces
- Database adapts to domain

**Current Reality:**
- Prisma schema defines structure
- Database-first approach
- No repository abstractions

**Impact**: Infrastructure drives business logic instead of vice versa

## 🎯 GREENFIELD GAME CHANGER

### Critical Context Shift

**Original Assumption**: Production system requiring migration
**Reality**: Greenfield project with no production constraints

This completely transforms our approach!

### New Strategic Options (Greenfield)

### Option 1: **"Clean Slate Rebuild"** ⭐⭐⭐

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Risk**: Low (no production impact)

```
Delete non-compliant code → Build from standards → Pure architecture
```

**Why Optimal for Greenfield:**
- ✅ No migration complexity
- ✅ No technical debt from day one
- ✅ Engineering OS can generate everything fresh
- ✅ No compromises on standards

**Execution:**
```bash
# Step 1: Document current features
/analyze-product  # Complete feature inventory

# Step 2: Archive existing code
git branch archive/pre-clean-architecture

# Step 3: Generate pure architecture
/create-spec "Generate complete Clean Architecture + FSD structure"
/execute-tasks

# Step 4: Implement features properly
/create-spec "Implement all features with Clean Architecture"
/execute-tasks
```

### Option 2: **"AI Codemod Blitz"**

**Timeline**: 1 weekend
**Risk**: Medium

Transform everything in parallel using AI-generated codemods

### Option 3: **"Foundation-First Architecture Sprint"** ⭐⭐

**Timeline**: 2 weeks
**Risk**: Low

**Week 1: Foundation**
```bash
# Monday: Contracts Package
/create-spec "Create contracts package with all API and domain contracts"
/execute-tasks

# Tuesday: Core Package  
/create-spec "Create core package with all business logic and use cases"
/execute-tasks

# Wednesday: Infrastructure Package
/create-spec "Create infrastructure package with repository implementations"
/execute-tasks

# Thursday: API Refactor
/create-spec "Refactor API package to thin controller layer using core"
/execute-tasks

# Friday: Frontend FSD
/create-spec "Restructure frontend to Feature-Sliced Design architecture"
/execute-tasks
```

**Week 2: Implementation**
```bash
# Implement features in parallel (no conflicts!)
/create-spec "Implement authentication feature with Clean Architecture"
/execute-tasks

/create-spec "Implement user management with Clean Architecture"
/execute-tasks

/create-spec "Implement organization management with Clean Architecture"
/execute-tasks
```

### Option 4: **"Delete and Regenerate"** (Nuclear Option) ☢️

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Risk**: Low (greenfield)

Most aggressive approach:

```bash
# Step 1: Extract requirements
/analyze-product  # Document what exists

# Step 2: Delete everything except standards
rm -rf apps/ packages/
# Keep only /docs/standards/

# Step 3: Generate from scratch
/plan-product  # Define the product
/create-spec "Generate complete monorepo following Clean Architecture and FSD"
/execute-tasks  # AI builds EVERYTHING from standards

# Step 4: Implement features
/create-spec "Implement all product features"
/execute-tasks
```

---

## Feature Extraction Requirements (Critical for Regeneration)

### The 100% Coverage Challenge

Before any regeneration, we need **complete feature inventory** to ensure nothing is lost.

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis Required

```bash
# 1. Codebase Analysis
/analyze-product  # Engineering OS deep scan

# 2. Route Analysis
- Every route in packages/api/src/routes/
- Every server action in apps/web/
- Every middleware and handler

# 3. UI Feature Analysis  
- Every page in apps/web/app/
- Every component in modules/
- Every form and interaction

# 4. Business Logic Analysis
- Database schemas (entities)
- Auth permissions (roles/actions)
- Business rules (validations, calculations)

# 5. Integration Analysis
- Payment providers
- Email providers
- Storage providers
- Third-party APIs
```

### Feature Catalog Template

```typescript
interface FeatureManifest {
  authentication: {
    features: string[];
    source_files: string[];
    business_rules: string[];
    ui_components: string[];
    api_endpoints: string[];
    database_entities: string[];
  };
  user_management: { /* ... */ };
  organizations: { /* ... */ };
  payments: { /* ... */ };
  // ... comprehensive catalog
}
```

### Extraction Tools Strategy

#### 1. **Automated Extraction**
```bash
# Route scanner
grep -r "router\." packages/api/
grep -r "export.*Router" packages/api/

# Component scanner
find apps/web -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l "export.*function"

# Form scanner (critical business features)
grep -r "useForm\|<form" apps/web/
```

#### 2. **Database Analysis**
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables;
SELECT * FROM information_schema.referential_constraints;
```

#### 3. **Test Analysis**
```bash
find . -name "*.test.ts" -o -name "*.spec.ts" | xargs grep -h "describe\|it\|test"
```

### Critical Success Factor: Feature Coverage Validation

Before deletion, we need:

1. **Feature manifest** with 100% coverage ✓
2. **Test scenarios** for each feature ✓
3. **Business rules** documented ✓
4. **UI/UX flows** captured ✓
5. **Integration configurations** saved ✓
6. **Data models** extracted ✓

## Engineering OS Framework Leverage

### The AI-Powered Development System

Engineering OS consists of:

1. **Standards DSL** (`/docs/standards/`) - Knowledge base
2. **Instructions DSL** (`.claude/commands/`) - Workflow engine  
3. **Specialized Agents** (`.claude/agents/`) - Execution layer

### Strategic Command Sequence

#### Analysis Phase
```bash
/analyze-product        # Deep codebase analysis
/refactor-codebase     # Get refactoring analysis with risk assessment
```

#### Planning Phase  
```bash
/plan-product          # Update mission/roadmap with migration plan
/create-spec "Feature extraction and documentation"
/create-spec "Clean Architecture migration plan"
```

#### Execution Phase
```bash
/create-tasks          # Generate TDD checklist
/execute-tasks         # AI implements with standards enforcement
```

### Intelligent Context Loading

The Engineering OS uses **surgical context loading**:
- When working on contracts → Loads integration-strategy.md
- When working on use cases → Loads clean-architecture.md  
- When working on frontend → Loads feature-sliced-design.md

This ensures the AI has **exactly the right knowledge** for each task.

### Parallel Agent Execution

The framework runs multiple agents simultaneously:
- **code-analyzer**: BiomeJS, madge, knip analysis
- **dependency-mapper**: Monorepo impact analysis  
- **file-creator**: Generate new structure
- **git-workflow**: Branch management
- **test-runner**: Validation
