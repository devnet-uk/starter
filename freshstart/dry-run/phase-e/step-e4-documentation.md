> - Runbooks for support, incident response, and domain-specific operations
> - ADR log finalized with statuses
> - Final tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) created post-verification

## Dry-Run Command Plan

1. `Claude: /create-spec "Documentation & handoff — runbooks, onboarding guide, final checkpoint"`
   - Standards navigation: `docs/standards/product/documentation.md`, `operations/runbooks.md`, `development/git-workflow.md` (final tagging guidance).
   - Variables: `PROJECT_PHASE=phase-e`, `HANDOFF_READY=true`.
2. `Claude: /create-tasks`
   - Expected tasks:
     - Update `DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt` with final metrics, risks, completion summary; mark `DEVNET-PROGRESS.md` as complete.
     - Produce runbooks (support, incident response, domain operations) in `docs/runbooks/`.
     - Finalize ADR log (statuses, links to implementation).
     - Prepare release tag `v1.0.0` (pending actual execution). Document verification suite results.
3. `Claude: /execute-tasks`
   - Executes documentation updates, ensures verification commands run green, summarizes final handoff steps.

## Expected Outcome

- Final project status recorded in checkpoint/progress documents.
- Comprehensive runbooks and onboarding guides published.
- ADR log reflects final decisions and statuses.
- Release tagging instructions captured (tag creation deferred until verification confirmed).
- Commit staged: `git add DEVNET-CHECKPOINT.txt DEVNET-PROGRESS.md docs/runbooks/` message `docs(phase-e): project handoff completed`.
