## Business Rules and Validation Logic

### Organization Rules
- **Unique Slugs**: Organization slugs must be unique across the platform
- **Name Requirements**: Organization names must be 2-50 characters
- **Owner Requirements**: Every organization must have at least one owner
- **Deletion Rules**: Only owners can delete organizations, must be empty or transfer ownership

### Membership Rules
- **Role Hierarchy**: Owner > Admin > Member (owners can do everything)
- **Permission Inheritance**: Admins can manage members but not other admins (unless owner)
- **Invitation Limits**: Rate limiting on invitation sending (max 10 per hour)
- **Email Uniqueness**: One membership per email address per organization

### Access Control Rules
- **Organization Scoping**: All data access must be scoped to user's organization membership
- **Role-Based Permissions**:
  - **Owner**: All organization operations, member management, billing, deletion
  - **Admin**: Member management (except owners), organization settings, invitations
  - **Member**: Read-only access to organization info and member list

### Invitation System Rules
- **Token Security**: Secure, time-limited invitation tokens (7 days expiration)
- **Email Verification**: Invited users must have verified email addresses
- **Role Assignment**: Invited users get assigned role, cannot be changed during invitation
- **Single Use**: Invitation tokens are single-use and expire after acceptance

## Database Schema Requirements

### Organizations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  slug VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  logo_url VARCHAR(500),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  
  -- Constraints
  CONSTRAINT check_name_length CHECK (LENGTH(name) >= 2 AND LENGTH(name) <= 100),
  CONSTRAINT check_slug_format CHECK (slug ~ '^[a-z0-9-]+$')
);
```

### Organization Members Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE organization_members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('owner', 'admin', 'member')),
  joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  invited_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  
  -- Unique membership per organization
  UNIQUE(organization_id, user_id)
);
```

### Organization Invitations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE organization_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'member')),
  token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  invited_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  accepted_at TIMESTAMP,
  
  -- Prevent duplicate pending invitations
  UNIQUE(organization_id, email) WHERE accepted_at IS NULL
);
```

### Indexes for Performance
```sql
-- Organization lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_slug ON organizations(slug);
CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_created_at ON organizations(created_at);

-- Member queries
CREATE INDEX idx_organization_members_org_id ON organization_members(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_organization_members_user_id ON organization_members(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_organization_members_role ON organization_members(role);

-- Invitation queries
CREATE INDEX idx_organization_invitations_email ON organization_invitations(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_organization_invitations_token ON organization_invitations(token);
CREATE INDEX idx_organization_invitations_expires_at ON organization_invitations(expires_at);
```
