# File Storage System - Comprehensive Feature Specification

> **Generated from Feature Manifest Analysis**  
> **Total Features**: 7 file storage features  
> **Domain**: File Upload, Storage & Management  
> **Status**: Clean Architecture Migration - Phase 1 Day 3

## Overview

The file storage system provides secure file upload, storage, and management capabilities with support for multiple storage providers, image processing, and CDN integration. The system handles user avatars, organization logos, and document uploads.

## Storage Architecture

### File Upload Features
- **Multi-provider support** (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, local storage)
- **File type validation** and security scanning
- **Image processing** with resizing and optimization
- **CDN integration** for fast file delivery
- **Upload progress tracking** and resumable uploads
- **File organization** with logical folder structures

### Storage Management
- **Quota management** per organization and user
- **File lifecycle management** with automatic cleanup
- **Version control** for file updates
- **Access control** with signed URLs and permissions
- **Backup and disaster recovery** for critical files
- **Analytics and usage tracking**

## Implementation Notes

The file storage system is designed to be provider-agnostic through service abstractions, enabling easy switching between different storage backends while maintaining consistent API interfaces.
