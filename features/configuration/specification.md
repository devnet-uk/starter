# Configuration Management System - Comprehensive Feature Specification

> **Generated from Feature Manifest Analysis**  
> **Total Features**: 18 configuration features  
> **Domain**: Application Configuration & Environment Management  
> **Status**: Clean Architecture Migration - Phase 1 Day 3

## Overview

The configuration management system provides centralized application configuration with environment variable management, type-safe configuration schemas, and runtime configuration validation. The system supports different deployment environments and external service configuration.

## Configuration Architecture

### Environment Configuration
- **Database configuration** with connection pooling and SSL settings
- **Authentication providers** (Better-Auth, OAuth providers)
- **Payment providers** (Stripe, LemonSqueezy, Polar, Creem)
- **Email services** configuration and templates
- **File storage** providers and CDN settings
- **Redis/caching** configuration
- **API keys and secrets** management

### Configuration Features
- **Type-safe configuration** using TypeScript and Zod validation
- **Environment-specific overrides** for development, staging, production
- **Secret management** with secure environment variable handling
- **Configuration validation** at application startup
- **Runtime configuration updates** for specific settings
- **Configuration documentation** with required vs optional settings

## Implementation Notes

Configuration management is implemented through centralized configuration objects with environment variable mapping and validation. This ensures type safety and prevents runtime errors due to missing or invalid configuration.
