## Implementation Priority

### Phase 2: Architecture Foundation Sprint (Week 1)

#### Day 1-2: Core Packages
1. **Contracts Package** → API schema definitions from all specifications
2. **Core Package** → Business logic from auth, users, organizations, payments

#### Day 3-4: Infrastructure & API
3. **Infrastructure Package** → Database repositories and external services
4. **API Package** → HTTP controllers and route handlers

#### Day 5: Frontend Structure
5. **Frontend Package** → Feature-Sliced Design structure with UI components

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation Sprint (Week 2)

#### Day 1: Authentication → [auth/specification.md](auth/specification.md)
#### Day 2: User Management → [users/specification.md](users/specification.md)  
#### Day 3: Organizations → [organizations/specification.md](organizations/specification.md)

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Database Integration
All specifications include database schemas designed for:
- **PostgreSQL 17.6** as primary database
- **Drizzle ORM 0.44.4+** for type-safe database operations
- **Proper indexing** for performance optimization
- **Foreign key constraints** for data integrity
- **Multi-tenant data isolation**

### Type Safety Strategy
- **Contracts Package** defines all API types using Zod schemas
- **End-to-end type safety** from database to frontend
- **OpenAPI generation** from Zod schemas
- **TypeScript strict mode** throughout the codebase

### Testing Strategy
Each specification includes:
- **Unit Tests** for business logic and validation
- **Integration Tests** for API endpoints and database operations
- **End-to-End Tests** for complete user workflows
- **Security Tests** for access control and data protection
- **Performance Tests** for scalability validation

### Security Implementation
- **Authentication** via Better-Auth with JWT tokens
- **Authorization** through role-based access control
- **Input Validation** using Zod schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention** through ORM usage
- **CORS Configuration** for frontend-backend communication

## Development Commands

### Feature Implementation
```bash
# Use Engineering OS commands for structured development
/create-spec    # Generate additional feature specifications
/create-tasks   # Generate TDD task lists from specifications  
/execute-tasks  # Implement features following Clean Architecture
```

### Quality Assurance
```bash
# Code quality and testing
pnpm lint       # BiomeJS linting
pnpm type-check # TypeScript validation
pnpm test       # Unit and integration tests
pnpm e2e        # End-to-end testing
```

### Build and Deployment
```bash
pnpm build      # Build all packages and applications
pnpm start      # Production server
pnpm dev        # Development environment
```
