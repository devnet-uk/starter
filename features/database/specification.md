# Database Schema System - Comprehensive Feature Specification

> **Generated from Feature Manifest Analysis**  
> **Total Features**: 40 database schema features  
> **Domain**: Data Persistence & Schema Management  
> **Status**: Clean Architecture Migration - Phase 1 Day 3

## Overview

The database schema system provides comprehensive data persistence using Drizzle ORM with support for multiple database providers (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite). The system includes entity relationships, schema migrations, data validation, and multi-tenant data isolation patterns.

## Database Architecture

### Supported Database Providers
- **PostgreSQL** (Primary production database)
- **MySQL** (Alternative production option)
- **SQLite** (Development and testing)

### Core Entity Schemas
- **Users** - User accounts and authentication data
- **Organizations** - Multi-tenant organization entities  
- **Sessions** - Authentication session management
- **Accounts** - OAuth provider account linking
- **Organization Members** - Organization membership relationships
- **Subscriptions** - Payment and billing data
- **Invitations** - Organization invitation system

### Schema Features
- **Multi-database compatibility** with provider-specific optimizations
- **Type-safe operations** using Drizzle ORM TypeScript integration
- **Relationship management** with foreign key constraints
- **Index optimization** for query performance
- **Migration system** for schema evolution
- **Data validation** at the database level

## Implementation Notes

The database schemas extracted from the feature manifest form the foundation of the Clean Architecture data persistence layer. These schemas will be consolidated and optimized during the migration process while maintaining full data compatibility.
