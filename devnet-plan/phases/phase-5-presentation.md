# Phase 5: Presentation Layer

## Prerequisites & Working Directory

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical: This phase MUST be executed in the devnet repository**

```bash
# Switch to devnet repository
cd ~/Projects/devnet

# Verify correct workspace
pwd  # Should show: ~/Projects/devnet
ls packages/  # Should list: core, infrastructure, contracts, etc.
```

**Required Workspaces**:
<!-- @include-from: docs/EngineeringOS/dsl/includes/common-snippets.md#required-workspaces, hash: 4a5914590c5e5cc7097eeddfa7da51d7d275f34f0d38e78be17a0d77e9f94b00 -->
These repositories should be open in your editor workspace:

- Primary: `~/Projects/devnet/` (implementation & execution)
- Secondary: `~/Projects/devnet.clean_architecture/` (standards reference)
<!-- @end-include -->

**Workspace Verification**:
<!-- @include-from: docs/EngineeringOS/dsl/includes/common-snippets.md#workspace-quick-check, hash: c549c84e03c8d6b6b773e27a8636f8ede1379adcbca9858e32ffc6c27889aed8 -->
Quick single-line check to confirm you are in the expected product repository directory.

```
[[ $(basename $(pwd)) == "devnet" ]] && echo "‚úÖ Correct workspace" || echo "‚ùå Wrong directory - run: cd ~/Projects/devnet"
```
<!-- @end-include -->

**If devnet repository doesn't exist**: Complete [Phase 0 - Infrastructure Setup](phase-0-infrastructure.md) first.

**Note**: Commands starting with "/" are Claude AI workflows, not shell scripts.

<!-- @include-from: docs/EngineeringOS/dsl/includes/common-snippets.md#workspace-checks, hash: 8cd810c9f2cfa00bdaa2c1eefd57680455604a990bf8eca80aaba27204124793 -->
Confirm you are in the correct repository and workspace.

```
pwd  # should end with your product repository name (for example, devnet)
ls packages/  # should list expected workspace packages (for example, core, infrastructure)
```

If the directory does not match, switch to the product repository before continuing.
<!-- @end-include -->

## Overview

<!-- phase-summary: anchor=overview; keep concise and current -->
**Coverage Target:** 95% UI implementation with Feature-Sliced Design and multi-tenant architecture  
**Status:** Ready for implementation  
**Duration:** 3 steps focusing on Next.js foundation, core features, and AI chat interface  

This phase implements the presentation layer with advanced Next.js architecture, embedded verification compliance, and comprehensive real-time features.

## Command Notation

Commands in this document use the following notation:
- `claude` code blocks = Commands for Claude Code to execute
- `bash` code blocks = Shell commands to run in terminal  
- "Claude:" prefix = Direct instruction for Claude to execute the following command

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 5 Green (Acceptance)

<!-- @include-from: docs/EngineeringOS/dsl/includes/common-snippets.md#verification-note, hash: 06a507e35e5f387b62627da1e7ca81c98750250cc34d9b736e56238630d35fc0 -->
Verification runs via `/execute-tasks` Step 6 using the verification runner in blocking mode by default.
- All tests marked as blocking must pass before completion.
- Do not run command-line samples for verification; they are illustrative only.
- Review Fix Commands from the report, apply changes, then re-run `/execute-tasks`.
<!-- @end-include -->

  - All BLOCKING UI tests pass in one session (e.g., FSD import direction, Server Components usage, accessibility and performance targets, coverage met).
  - See this file‚Äôs verification gates and code-style/performance standards for specifics.
