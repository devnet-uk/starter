# Archive Note: implementation-plan.md

This note marks the original dispatcher as archived for review. We are trialing a routing‑first slim dispatcher:

- Original (kept in place): `devnet-plan/implementation-plan.md`
- Slim version (use for routing): `devnet-plan/implementation-plan.slim.md`

Rationale
- Reduce token usage at entry by keeping dispatcher routing‑only
- Move global guidance to `devnet-plan/context/agent-conventions.md`

If you want to fully move the original into `devnet-plan/archive/` and replace it with the slim version, confirm and we’ll perform a safe move with a pointer.
