# Archive Note: phase-0-infrastructure.md

This note marks the original Phase 0 document as archived for review. We are trialing a lean Phase 0 document:

- Original (kept in place): `devnet-plan/phases/phase-0-infrastructure.md`
- Lean version (use for execution): `devnet-plan/phases/phase-0-infrastructure.lean.md`
- Template basis for future phases: `devnet-plan/templates/phase-template.md`

Rationale
- Reduce tokens by keeping only execution‑critical guidance inline
- Centralize verbose guidance in conventions/standards and link when needed

If you want to fully move the original into `devnet-plan/archive/` and replace it with the lean version, confirm and we’ll perform a safe move with a pointer.
