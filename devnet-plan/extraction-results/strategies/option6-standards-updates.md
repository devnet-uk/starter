## Event Sourcing Testing Patterns

### Given-When-Then Event Testing
```typescript
describe('User Aggregate', () => {
  it('should ban user when admin executes ban command', async () => {
    // Given - existing events
    const events = [
      new UserRegistered('user-1', 'test@example.com', 'John Doe'),
      new UserOnboardingCompleted('user-1', new Date())
    ];
    
    // When - executing command
    const command = new BanUser('user-1', 'Violation of terms', 'admin-1');
    const newEvents = await userAggregate.handle(events, command);
    
    // Then - expect events
    expect(newEvents).toEqual([
      new UserBanned('user-1', 'Violation of terms', 'admin-1', expect.any(Date))
    ]);
  });
});
```

### Projection Testing
```typescript
describe('User Projection', () => {
  it('should build correct read model from events', async () => {
    // Given - event stream
    const events = [
      new UserRegistered('user-1', 'test@example.com', 'John Doe'),
      new UserBanned('user-1', 'Terms violation', 'admin-1', new Date())
    ];
    
    // When - building projection
    const readModel = await userProjection.build(events);
    
    // Then - verify read model
    expect(readModel).toEqual({
      id: 'user-1',
      email: 'test@example.com',
      name: 'John Doe',
      status: 'banned',
      banReason: 'Terms violation'
    });
  });
});
```

### Eventually Consistent Integration Testing
```typescript
describe('User Registration Flow', () => {
  it('should handle registration with eventual consistency', async () => {
    // When - executing command
    await commandBus.send(new RegisterUser('test@example.com', 'John Doe'));
    
    // Then - wait for projection update
    await waitFor(() => 
      expect(userQuery.findByEmail('test@example.com')).resolves.toMatchObject({
        email: 'test@example.com',
        name: 'John Doe'
      })
    );
  });
});
```
```

### 4. `docs/standards/data/README.md`

**Current State:** Traditional database design patterns

**Required New Structure:**
```markdown
# Data Standards for Event Sourcing

## Core Concepts

### Event Design
- Events are immutable facts about what happened
- Events should be named in past tense (UserRegistered, not RegisterUser)
- Events contain only data that was known at the time of occurrence
- Events should be self-contained and not require external lookups

### Event Schema Evolution
- All events must include version numbers
- Backward compatibility required for event consumers
- Upcasting patterns for event schema migrations
- Breaking changes require new event types

### Read Model Design
- Read models are projections optimized for queries
- Multiple read models can be built from same event stream
- Read models should be eventually consistent
- Read model rebuilding must be supported

### Consistency Boundaries
- Strong consistency within aggregates only
- Eventual consistency between aggregates
- Event ordering within aggregate guaranteed
- Cross-aggregate operations via sagas/process managers
```

### 5. `docs/standards/api/README.md`

**Current State:** RESTful API patterns

**Required Extensions:**
```markdown
# API Standards for CQRS

## Command APIs
Commands represent business operations and should:
- Use POST requests exclusively
- Return acknowledgment, not business data
- Include command validation
- Generate events on success

Example:
```typescript
POST /api/commands/users/register
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "user"
}

Response:
{
  "commandId": "cmd-123",
  "acknowledged": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-29T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Query APIs
Queries retrieve data from read models and should:
- Use GET requests exclusively
- Return only read model data
- Support pagination and filtering
- Be eventually consistent

Example:
```typescript
GET /api/queries/users?email=user@example.com

Response:
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "user-123",
      "email": "user@example.com", 
      "name": "John Doe",
      "status": "active",
      "lastUpdated": "2025-01-29T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Event Streaming APIs
Real-time event subscriptions via WebSocket or SSE:
```typescript
GET /api/events/stream?aggregate=user&fromVersion=100

Response: Server-Sent Events stream
data: {"eventType": "UserRegistered", "aggregateId": "user-123", ...}
data: {"eventType": "UserBanned", "aggregateId": "user-124", ...}
```
```

### 6. `docs/standards/security/README.md`

**Current State:** Traditional authentication and authorization

**Required Extensions:**
```markdown
# Security Standards for Event Sourcing

## Event Security
- **Event Encryption**: Sensitive data in events must be encrypted at rest
- **Event Signing**: Critical events should include cryptographic signatures
- **Event Access Control**: Read access to event streams requires authorization
- **Audit Trail**: All event access must be logged for compliance

## Command Authorization
- Commands must include user context for authorization
- Command authorization happens before event generation
- Failed authorization must not generate events
- Authorization decisions should be logged

## Read Model Security
- Read models inherit authorization from source events
- Personal data in projections subject to privacy controls
- Read model access must validate user permissions
- Cached projections must respect user context

## GDPR Compliance with Event Sourcing
- **Right to be Forgotten**: Implement via compensating events
- **Data Minimization**: Store only necessary data in events
- **Consent Tracking**: Track consent changes via events
- **Data Export**: Support exporting user's event history
```

## üìÅ New Standards Files Required

### 1. `docs/standards/event-sourcing/event-design.md`

```markdown
# Event Design Standards

## Event Naming Conventions
- Use past tense: `UserRegistered`, `OrderCancelled`, `PaymentProcessed`
- Include aggregate name: `User*`, `Order*`, `Payment*`
- Be specific: `UserEmailChanged` not `UserUpdated`
- Avoid technical terms: `UserBanned` not `UserStatusUpdated`

## Event Schema Standards
```typescript
interface DomainEvent {
  eventId: string;           // UUID v4
  eventType: string;         // Past tense, PascalCase
  aggregateId: string;       // UUID of the aggregate
  aggregateType: string;     // User, Organization, etc.
  version: number;           // Event schema version
  timestamp: Date;           // When event occurred
  data: object;             // Event-specific data
  metadata: {               // Optional metadata
    userId?: string;         // Who initiated the action
    correlationId?: string;  // Request tracing ID
    causationId?: string;    // ID of command that caused event
  };
}
```

## Event Data Guidelines
- Include only data available at event time
- Use primitive types when possible
- Avoid nested objects unless necessary
- Include identifiers for referenced entities
- Don't include computed or derived data

## Event Versioning Strategy
- Start all events at version 1
- Increment version for breaking changes
- Support multiple versions simultaneously
- Provide upcasters for old versions
```

### 2. `docs/standards/event-sourcing/aggregates.md`

```markdown
# Aggregate Design Standards

## Aggregate Structure
```typescript
abstract class AggregateRoot {
  protected id: string;
  protected version: number = 0;
  private pendingEvents: DomainEvent[] = [];

  // Load aggregate from events
  static fromEvents(events: DomainEvent[]): AggregateRoot {
    const aggregate = new this();
    events.forEach(event => aggregate.apply(event));
    return aggregate;
  }

  // Apply event to aggregate state
  protected abstract apply(event: DomainEvent): void;

  // Raise new domain event
  protected raise(event: DomainEvent): void {
    this.pendingEvents.push(event);
    this.apply(event);
    this.version++;
  }

  // Get uncommitted events
  getUncommittedEvents(): DomainEvent[] {
    return [...this.pendingEvents];
  }

  // Mark events as committed
  markEventsAsCommitted(): void {
    this.pendingEvents = [];
  }
}
```

## Aggregate Design Principles
- One aggregate per consistency boundary
- Aggregates should be small and focused
- Cross-aggregate operations via events
- Aggregates validate business rules
- No queries within aggregates
```

### 3. `docs/standards/event-sourcing/projections.md`

```markdown
# Projection Building Standards

## Projection Handler Pattern
```typescript
interface ProjectionHandler {
  eventType: string;
  handle(event: DomainEvent, readModel: any): Promise<void>;
}

class UserProjectionHandler implements ProjectionHandler {
  eventType = 'UserRegistered';
  
  async handle(event: UserRegistered, userReadModel: UserReadModel) {
    await userReadModel.create({
      id: event.aggregateId,
      email: event.data.email,
      name: event.data.name,
      registeredAt: event.timestamp
    });
  }
}
```

## Projection Design Guidelines
- One projection per query use case
- Denormalize data for query efficiency
- Handle event order gracefully
- Support projection rebuilding
- Include last processed event metadata
```

### 4. `docs/standards/cqrs/commands.md`

```markdown
# Command Standards

## Command Design
```typescript
interface Command {
  commandId: string;        // UUID for idempotency
  commandType: string;      // PascalCase, imperative
  aggregateId: string;      // Target aggregate
  data: object;            // Command payload
  metadata: {
    userId: string;         // Who is executing command
    timestamp: Date;        // When command was issued
    correlationId?: string; // Request correlation
  };
}
```

## Command Naming Conventions
- Use imperative form: `RegisterUser`, `BanUser`, `ProcessPayment`
- Include aggregate name: `RegisterUser` not `Register`
- Be specific about action: `BanUser` not `UpdateUser`

## Command Validation
- Validate command structure before handling
- Check authorization before processing
- Validate business rules in aggregate
- Return meaningful error messages
```

### 5. `docs/standards/cqrs/queries.md`

```markdown
# Query Standards  

## Query Design
```typescript
interface Query {
  queryId: string;         // UUID for tracing
  queryType: string;       // PascalCase, question form
  parameters: object;      // Query parameters
  metadata: {
    userId: string;        // Who is querying
    timestamp: Date;       // When query was made
  };
}
```

## Query Naming Conventions
- Use question form: `GetUserById`, `FindUsersByEmail`
- Be specific: `GetActiveUsers` not `GetUsers`
- Include main entity: `GetUserOrganizations`

## Query Response Standards
- Always return consistent structure
- Include metadata about data freshness
- Support pagination for collections
- Handle not found cases gracefully
```

### 6. `docs/standards/operational/event-store-operations.md`

```markdown
# Event Store Operations

## Backup Procedures
```bash
# PostgreSQL event store backup
pg_dump --table=events --table=snapshots eventstore_db > backup.sql

# Event replay validation
psql -d test_db < backup.sql
npm run validate-projections
```

## Event Archival
- Archive events older than 7 years to cold storage  
- Maintain ability to replay from archives
- Keep snapshots for fast aggregate loading
- Document archival and restoration procedures

## Performance Monitoring
- Monitor event append rates
- Track projection lag times
- Alert on event processing failures
- Monitor event store disk usage
```

### 7. `docs/standards/operational/projection-rebuilding.md`

```markdown
# Projection Rebuilding Standards

## Rebuilding Procedures
```bash
# Stop projection processing
npm run projection:stop user-projection

# Clear existing read model
npm run projection:clear user-projection

# Rebuild from events
npm run projection:rebuild user-projection --from-beginning

# Resume normal processing
npm run projection:start user-projection
```

## Zero-Downtime Rebuilding
1. Create new projection version (v2)
2. Build v2 projection from events
3. Switch application to v2 when caught up
4. Remove v1 projection

## Validation Procedures
- Compare projection counts with event counts
- Validate key business rules in projections
- Test projection performance after rebuild
```
