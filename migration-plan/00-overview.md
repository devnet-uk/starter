# Overview and Approach

Goal: Transition this project to full compliance with Engineering OS (EOS) while preserving delivery velocity and safety. This document summarizes objectives, approach, and high-level outcomes.

Objectives
- Align code, workflows, and CI/CD with EOS Standards DSL (docs/standards) and Instructions DSL (.claude/commands)
- Establish blocking verification gates for critical standards
- Define a safe, phased migration with measurable acceptance criteria
- Minimize disruption to ongoing work; avoid destructive changes

Methodology
- Start from the root dispatcher `docs/standards/standards.md`; route ≤3 hops to relevant standards
- Use local utilities for standards validation and verification where safe:
  - `node scripts/validate-standards.mjs`
  - `node scripts/verification-shim.mjs --files=<standard> --mode=blocking`
- Catalog current repo state (structure, tooling, practices)
- Build a compliance matrix mapping current → target EOS state
- Propose a phased roadmap with risk-managed increments and verifiable gates

EOS Layers in Scope
- Designing Systems: architecture, layering, integration strategy
- Writing Code: code style, naming, React/TypeScript patterns
- Securing Applications: server actions, auth patterns, API security
- Configuring Tools: monorepo, package scripts, TypeScript, CI/CD
- Using Libraries: Drizzle ORM, Hono, TanStack Query, Zustand, Next Safe Action, Vercel AI, oRPC
- Optimizing Systems: performance, observability, Core Web Vitals, bundle optimization

Outcomes (planned)
- Clear compliance status and prioritized gaps
- Roadmap with milestones and acceptance tests (verification-blocks)
- Governance plan (pre-commit hooks, PR checks, protected branches)
- ADR backlog for durable architectural decisions

Constraints
- Planning only; no code changes
- May create files under `migration-plan/` to record analysis and plan
- Ignore `@devnet-plan/` for this effort
